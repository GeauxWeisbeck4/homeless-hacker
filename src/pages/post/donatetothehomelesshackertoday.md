Thank you for stopping by and checking out the Homeless Hacker! Lisa and I are proud of our work putting this little project together.

It hasn't been easy work to say the least - you know, programming a website, creating all the various publications, and writing blog posts each day. It really is a lot of work, especially when you don't even have electricity in the tent you live in. ðŸ˜‰

Right now we are working on more ways to contribute to our cause and make it easier for you to help us make our situation better, but unfortunately you lose things (or get them stolen) when you live out on the streets long enough, so we only have a CashApp currently as a way to receive money.

If you would like to contribute to help us out, you can direct CashApp payments to the following address:

We thank you for your support and look forward to sharing our experience through this journey with you!
