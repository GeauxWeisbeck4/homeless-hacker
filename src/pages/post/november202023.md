Well Mondays are always... Mondays. Today wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the most exciting day nonetheless.

## Monday - November 20th, 2023

Lisa and I purchased our new favorite gadget yesterday with some money we made from panhandling - our beloved [Buddy Indoor Safe Propane Heater](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Mr-Heater-9000-BTU-Portable-Radiant-Propane-Heater/3353726?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-sol-_-ggl-_-LIA_SOL_237_Seasonal-Heat-Coolers-_-3353726-_-local-_-0-_-0&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiApOyqBhDlARIsAGfnyMq9TomhFWQrx87rnuJqhd6lHqwV9c0whEM86Y-gnDeCB6Z-FJIzwlgaAlb2EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). We needed something to keep us warm with the chilly months coming up and boy is this badboy up for the task!

It has a tip-over off safety switch, a low oxygen safety shut off valve, and it is easy to fire up and heat up 225 sq. feet of tent in just 15 minutes! I know y'all are probably thinking, "Oh no, y'all are going to get carbon monoxide poisoning!". Fear not, we have ventilation in our tent from our dog Magnolia tearing it open. So yeah, that's the excitement from our weekend.

## Off to social services

We spent our Monday in the perfect place to spend a Monday - in the social services office. We both got denied for food stamps (how can you get denied when your homeless?) and had to stop by and fill out a new food stamp form. This time we gave them an updated cell phone number, which is actually on because we paid up our bill finally.

It was a painful trip like usual though, waiting for a couple hours just to find out why we were denied. We spent those couple hours waiting with the crying baby and inattentive parent, tearing our eardrums apart for the better part of the waiting period. Well, we got it over with and are alive and well.

## Free sandwiches at Jason's and preparing for the rain

We went over to our local sandwich shop again, Jason's Deli, and were gifted two lovely, Chicken Paninis - for free! After our lovely dinner, we retired over to Starbucks (where I'm currently writing this post) and are enjoying their very jazzy Christmas music and listening to the employees complain about their work schedules. At least y'all have jobs! Sheeesh.

We are nervous for the evening and the next couple days as it is supposed to shower nonstop. Rain is always awful out here because it is hard to get dry once wet and cold. Also, sometimes it leaks through the tent and the bottom of the tent gets soaked with rain. Sigh... let's hope for the best!

If you want to donate to our cause, we will get a hotel room and hole up - ahh, don't worry about it. We'll tough it out - or melt in the cold, North Carolina, November rain.
