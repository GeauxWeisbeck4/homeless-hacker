Come join the Fediverse fun and follow me [the Homeless Hacker on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@homeless_hacker)!

## Follow @homeless_hacker on the hachyderm server on Mastodon

I prefer the Mastodon platform to the Antisemitic-hate-filled place of Twitter. It is a much friendlier and much more awesome social network. If you don't know much about the Fediverse, I will be creating a post to explain it in greater detail, so stay tuned.

You can learn more about the Fediverse at this [awesome website, Fediverse.party](https://fediverse.party/) in the meantime!
