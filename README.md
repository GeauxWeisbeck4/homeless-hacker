# Homeless Hacker Website

Welcome to the Homeless Hacker Website repository! This website was created as a place for my fiance and I to share our homeless story as well as a hub for all of the Homeless Hacker content that I share. The Homeless Hacker is a project I created to share coding tutorials as well as my experience struggling with homelessness. It sounds obscure, because it is! Nobody else is out here trying to make a living as a programmer, so I hope somebody takes notice and wants to either help out financially or provide me a job.

If that sounds selfish, maybe it is. But I have been coding for over three years and looking for a job for two years and really need some help. If you'd like to help out, please reach out to me at andrewweisbeck4@gmail.com or if you want to donate financially, send your kind donations on CashApp to $lisaweisbeck4.

We thank you for your support and kindness!
